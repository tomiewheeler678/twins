<h2>Piggy and Munchkin, the twins</h2>
<p> This page is about 2 of my 4 dogs. Henley(piggy) and Munchkin. We call them the twins because they are best friends and can't go anywhere without each other. They also have the same face. Henley will be 5 years old in March and we have had her since she was 6 weeks old. Muchkin will be 3 to 4 years old, also in March. We don't really know muchkin's birthday, so we celebrate them together since we call them the twins anyways. They get cupcakes. They are happy. </p>
